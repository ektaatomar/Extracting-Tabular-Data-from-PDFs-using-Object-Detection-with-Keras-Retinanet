# Extracting-Tabular-Data-from-PDFs-using-Object-Detection-with-Keras-Retinanet
Inspired by work of https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet.git 

## GPU Requirements
To fulfill the GPU needs, we utilized Google Colab platform as our personal resources were limited in that capacity. Not to mention that Colab GPU allocation have it's own strategies, depending on your past usage your allocation may differ. In our case, we managed to get pretty good model with these resources.

## Enabling GPU on Colab

## Datasets
We are aware that finding a quality public dataset for table detection can be a task, so here are few that we used in our training.

## Required Files

Images- JPEG is the prefered format, we have also included the code to convert PNG into JPEG files.
Annotations- XML files. We encorage to develop understandiing of the annotation file formats. Respective annotations are included in these datasets.
We annotated all the tables under 'table' class name.

When using your own pdfs and images, annotations can be generated by using:
https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/
You can read about the background here:
https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg

Train and Test text files- These essentially contain the name of image files(without the extention) to be used for training and testing.

## Preparing CSV Files for Training
After getting all above files ready and in place, we need to create CSV files with the annotation information with the help of build_logos.py script. For obvious reasons, it would generate Train and Test CSV files for next steps of training and validation.

## Training Model 
Trained the model on our dataset while using the pretrained COCO weights which made the training faster and more precise. As advised, evaluated its performance, which turned out to be very impressive.
