# Extracting-Tabular-Data-from-PDFs-using-Object-Detection-with-Keras-Retinanet
Inspired by work of https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet.git 

## GPU Requirements
To fulfill the GPU needs, we utilized Google Colab platform as our personal resources were limited in that capacity. Not to mention that Colab GPU allocation have it's own strategies, depending on your past usage your allocation may differ. In our case, we managed to get pretty good accuracy with these resources.

## Datasets
We are aware that finding a quality public dataset for table detection can be a task, so here are few that we used in our training.

## Required files

Images- JPEG is the prefered format, we have also included the code to convert PNG into JPEG files.
Annotations- XML files. We encorage to develop understandiing of the annotation file formats. Respective annotations are included in these datasets.
We annotated all the tables under 'table' class name.

When using your own pdfs and images, annotations can be generated by using:

You can read about the background here:

Train and Test text files- These essentially contain the name of image files(without the extention) to be used for training and testing.
